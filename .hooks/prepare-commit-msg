# Commit message policy (so that it will look great in GitHub):
#
#   Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary
#
#   More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
#   characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
#   subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
#   line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
#   the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
#   two together.
#
#   Write your commit message in the present tense: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
#   bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated by
#   commands like git merge and git revert.
